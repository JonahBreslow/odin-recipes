# odin-recipes
This is my ~45 minute attempt at the first [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) "project".
## Goals
1. Simply create the html webpage for a collection of recipes. 
2. There should be at least 2 recipes
3. (My own flare) add some nutrition information (if time permits)

## Non-goals
As of right now, there are a few non-goals that are out of scope.
1. Fancy CSS styling
2. Server side anything
