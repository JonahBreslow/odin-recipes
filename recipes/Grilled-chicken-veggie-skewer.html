    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 zucchini, sliced into rounds</li>
      <li>8 cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Wooden skewers (pre-soaked in water to prevent burning)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, dried
        oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well to make the marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken cubes in a separate bowl and pour half of the marinade
        over them. Toss the chicken to ensure even coating, then cover and
        refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the chicken is marinating, prepare the vegetables. Thread the
        marinated chicken, bell peppers, red onion, zucchini, and cherry
        tomatoes alternately onto the pre-soaked wooden skewers.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Brush the grill grates with a bit of oil to prevent sticking. Place the
        skewers on the grill and cook for about 10-12 minutes, turning
        occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are
        tender and slightly charred.
      </li>
      <li>
        While grilling, baste the skewers with the remaining marinade to enhance
        the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooked, remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a
        few minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
